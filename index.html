                    <p>Emphasise that HIV and Ulcerative Colitis are both chronic, lifelong conditions. The CMV Ulcerative Colitis is a direct result of your HIV status, making your case particularly complex to manage.</p>

                    <div class="example">
                        <h4>Initial Symptoms and Diagnosis</h4>
                        <p>"I began experiencing severe weight loss and excessive diarrhoea over about four months in Summer 2022. I lost over a stone in weight which was very concerning. After several tests, I was diagnosed with HIV in November 2022 and immediately started lifelong antiviral medication. The diagnosis was devastating, but things deteriorated further when I was rushed to hospital in January 2023 with excruciating abdominal pain. I needed emergency surgery for a telescopic bowel - where part of my intestine had collapsed into itself. During recovery, in February 2023, I was diagnosed with Ulcerative Colitis, which doctors explained was a CMV (cytomegalovirus) colitis triggered by my compromised immune system due to HIV."</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="example">
                        <h4>Recent Treatment Journey</h4>
                        <p>"My condition has been extremely difficult to manage. I was hospitalised again at the end of June 2023 due to a severe flare-up where I was passing large amounts of blood and couldn't keep any food down. They prescribed a very high dose of prednisolone, but when we tried to reduce the dose, my symptoms immediately flared up again. In November 2023, I had another sigmoidoscopy which confirmed the CMV Ulcerative Colitis was still active despite treatments. Most recently, I've started Infliximab infusions - I've had two so far, with the second one just yesterday. The plan is for my next two infusions to be administered by a nurse at home, after which I'll need to transition to self-injections for what will likely be the rest of my life. This is on top of my daily HIV medication which I can never stop taking."</p>

                        <h4>Public Accident Example</h4>
                        <p>"In January of this year, I was in town shopping when I suddenly felt that familiar intense cramping pain and immediate need for a toilet. The closest public facilities were in a department store about 100 metres away. Despite moving as quickly as I could, I simply couldn't make it in time. I had a complete accident in my clothing in the middle of the shopping centre. The shame and humiliation were overwhelming - I had to call my partner to bring fresh clothes and help me home. I was in tears, and several people were staring. Since then, I've been absolutely terrified of going shopping or being in public spaces without immediately accessible toilets. I now wear incontinence pads whenever I leave the house, but even these aren't enough when I have a severe episode. This fear constantly limits where I can go and what I can do."</p>

                    <div class="example">
                        <h4>Work Example</h4>
                        <p>"At work, the toilet urgency has caused significant problems and embarrassment. Last month during a team meeting, I suddenly experienced that unmistakable cramping sensation and knew I had about 30 seconds before an accident. I had to abruptly stand up and rush out in the middle of my colleague's presentation without explanation. I barely made it to the toilet, and when I returned, everyone was looking at me. My manager later asked if everything was alright, and I had to explain my condition, which was mortifying. I now sit nearest to the door in all meetings and have had to disclose my condition to my entire team because of these episodes. Some days I need to use the toilet 10-15 times during working hours. I've had to refuse client visits and field trips because I can't guarantee access to facilities. There have been times when I've simply had to work from home because my symptoms were too severe and unpredictable to risk being in the office."</p>

                        <h4>Home Example</h4>
                        <p>"Even at home, the toilet urgency severely disrupts my daily life. I've had to install a toilet grab rail because I often need to rush so quickly that I've fallen trying to get there in time. Just last week, I was in the shower when the urgency hit - I had to immediately get out, still covered in soap, and rush to the toilet leaving water everywhere. I've learned I can't take baths anymore because getting out quickly enough is impossible. When preparing meals, I've had to abandon cooking multiple times - once leaving a pan on the hob which nearly caused a fire because I couldn't wait even 30 seconds to turn off the heat. At night, I wake up 3-4 times needing to rush to the toilet, severely disrupting my sleep and leaving me exhausted. I've had to put waterproof coverings on my bed because of occasional night-time accidents."</p>

                    <div class="example">
                        <h4>Pain Severity Example</h4>
                        <p>"Two weeks ago, I experienced one of my worst pain episodes. It began while I was preparing dinner, a sudden stabbing pain in my lower abdomen that rapidly intensified until I was doubled over. The pain was so severe that I couldn't stand upright - I had to hold onto the kitchen counter to prevent myself from collapsing. It felt like someone was simultaneously twisting and stabbing my intestines. I broke out in a cold sweat and began trembling uncontrollably. I couldn't even make it to the sofa without my partner's help. Once there, I couldn't find any position that relieved the pain - lying flat made it worse, sitting up was impossible. I had to curl on my side with my knees drawn up to my chest. The intense spasms lasted for nearly three hours, during which time I also needed to use the toilet repeatedly, each movement intensifying the pain. I couldn't eat, couldn't concentrate on anything besides the pain, and was completely incapacitated. My partner wanted to call an ambulance, but I knew from previous experience that hospital trips for these episodes usually result in waiting for hours only to be given pain relief and sent home. Eventually, after taking my emergency pain medication, the intensity subsided to a dull but persistent ache that continued through the night."</p>

                    <div class="example">
                        <h4>Fatigue Impact Example</h4>
                        <p>"The fatigue I experience is unlike normal tiredness - it's a profound, whole-body exhaustion that medication doesn't touch. Last Wednesday was typical of my bad days. I woke up already feeling drained despite sleeping for 9 hours (though interrupted by toilet trips). I managed to shower and dress but had to sit down twice during the process because even these simple tasks were exhausting. By the time I got to work, I felt as though I'd already worked a full day. My brain was foggy, making it difficult to follow conversations or remember task instructions. I had to re-read emails multiple times to comprehend them. At lunchtime, I couldn't face going to the staff room and instead rested my head on my desk because I felt too tired to even eat. By 2pm, my manager noticed my condition and suggested I go home as I was clearly struggling. Once home, I collapsed on the sofa and slept for three hours. When my partner came home, I couldn't even muster the energy to help with dinner preparation. This level of fatigue means I have to carefully prioritize what little energy I have - if I have a social event planned, I need to rest the entire day before and know I'll need at least a day to recover afterwards. Simple household tasks like laundry or hoovering now need to be spread across different days. I can no longer do any of the physical activities I previously enjoyed like hiking or swimming because the fatigue makes them impossible."</p>

                        <h4>Cancelled Holiday Example</h4>
                        <p>"Last November, I had to cancel a long-planned family holiday to Florida, losing over ¬£2,000 in non-refundable deposits and causing huge disappointment for everyone. We'd been planning this trip for over a year, but as the date approached, my symptoms became increasingly severe. The thought of an 8-hour flight with unpredictable toilet access was terrifying. I spoke with my gastroenterologist, who provided a letter advising against travel due to my condition's instability. The letter explained that the stress of travel could significantly worsen my symptoms and that the risk of a severe flare in a foreign country was substantial. Beyond the financial loss, the emotional impact was devastating. It was meant to be our first proper family holiday in years, and I felt I'd let everyone down. This wasn't just a holiday - it represented a chance for some normalcy despite my conditions. Having to cancel it really brought home how restricted my life has become. Since then, I haven't been able to make any travel plans at all, as my condition remains unpredictable and my anxiety about being away from familiar toilet facilities has only increased."</p>

                        <h4>Work Commute Example</h4>
                        <p>"My 45-minute commute to work has become a daily source of extreme anxiety. I have to carefully plan the entire journey around toilet access. I can only take a specific route where I know the locations of every public toilet, petrol station, and restaurant with facilities. Before leaving home, I take Imodium medication and don't eat or drink anything to reduce the risk of needing the toilet. I wear incontinence pads as a precaution. Last month, I was stuck in unexpected traffic and began experiencing severe urgency. There was no way to exit the road or find a toilet. I had to use an empty bottle in my car as an emergency measure, which was humiliating beyond words. Even with all my precautions, I've had three accidents in my car in the past six months. After each incident, I've had to call in sick the following day due to the emotional distress and need to thoroughly clean my car. I've requested to work from home more frequently, but my role often requires physical presence. Each morning, I experience intense anxiety about the journey, sometimes resulting in panic attacks before I even leave the house. This daily stress triggers my symptoms further, creating a vicious cycle."</p>

                    <div class="example">
                        <h4>Local Travel Limitations</h4>
                        <p>"Even local travel has become extremely difficult. I can no longer use public transport at all because of unpredictable toilet access. When I tried to take a bus to town three months ago, I had an urgency episode and the driver refused to stop between designated stops. I had an accident on the bus, in full view of other passengers. The shame was unbearable, and I've not attempted public transport since. For any journey beyond a 5-minute drive, I need someone with me for support in case of an emergency. I've mapped out all public toilets in my local area and cannot go anywhere that doesn't have facilities I can reach within 30 seconds. When visiting friends, I always need to know the toilet location immediately upon arrival and often decline invitations if I'm unfamiliar with the area. I've had to pull over while driving numerous times due to sudden urgency, sometimes in unsafe locations because there simply wasn't an option. I now avoid driving on motorways entirely because of limited stopping options. My mobility has shrunk to a small radius around my home, effectively trapping me in a very limited area where I feel somewhat safe."
